## Description

Not everybody owns EAGLE or wants to go through the trouble of opening it just to view a schematic. Here I keep an updated list of schematics, in PDF form, for all Mutable Instruments modules.

If I am ever missing a schematic, please let me know by [opening up an issue]({{site.repository}}/issues) on GitHub and I will update this page as soon as possible!

### GitHub Fork

If you prefer instead, you can browse [my fork of Olivier Gillet's GitHub repo](https://github.com/BGR360/eurorack), which contains all of the schematics in the same directories as their respective EAGLE files.

## Schematic PDFs

{% assign schematics_url = site.data.mutable_instruments_schematics.schematics_directory %}

{% for schematic in site.data.mutable_instruments_schematics.schematics %}

#### {{ schematic.name }}
  
  {% if schematic.files %}

    {% for file in schematic.files %}

[{{ file }}]({{schematics_url | relative_url}}{{file}})

    {% endfor %}
  
  {% else if schematic.file %}

[{{ schematic.file }}]({{schematics_url | relative_url}}{{schematic.file}})

  {% endif %}

{% endfor %}
